## Literature Survey


#### 1. Narrow your scope:

Within drug classification: Focus on research related to patient scheduling and appointment management in clinics, hospitals, or healthcare systems. Look for studies analyzing efficiency, patient satisfaction, resource allocation, etc., in scheduling for various drug-related appointments (follow-ups, consultations, medication dispensing).

Within OrangeHRM: Define the specific aspects of your scheduling/appointment system you want to improve. Are you looking at employee appointments with HR professionals, departmental meetings, training sessions, or something else?

#### 2. Search for relevant materials:

Use academic databases like PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Use keywords like "drug classification," "patient scheduling," "appointment systems," "healthcare management," combined with terms like "HR software," "HRM," "workforce management," and specific aspects of your chosen OrangeHRM focus.

Explore industry publications, reports, and white papers from HRM software vendors and consulting firms. Look for case studies or analyses of successful scheduling/appointment implementations in HR departments.

#### 3. Analyze your findings:

Identify strengths and weaknesses of existing scheduling/appointment systems in both drug classification and HRM contexts. Look for common challenges and successful solutions.

Analyze methodologies and techniques used in previous research and implementations. Consider adapting or adopting relevant approaches for your OrangeHRM project.

Identify gaps in knowledge or areas where existing research doesn't address your specific needs. This could be an opportunity for your OrangeHRM project to contribute new insights or solutions.

#### 4. Consider contacting researchers or practitioners in both drug classification and HRM fields for expert insights and recommendations.

#### 5. Look for conferences or workshops that cover both scheduling/appointment systems and HRM software.

#### 6.Use visualization tools like mind maps or concept maps to organize your findings and identify potential connections between the two research areas.

#### 7. Conclusion
In conclusion, the literature review provides a foundation for optimizing software testing in the OrangeHRM project. By conducting a thorough and focused literature survey, you can gain valuable insights from drug classification research to inform the design and implementation of your OrangeHRM project, potentially leading to a more efficient 
and effective scheduling/appointment system for your organization.
